# 👨🏼‍💻 Exercises
Try out the profilers relevant to your own system with some sample programs.  
Now try it with some of your own code from before you started on the guide!

## Setting Up a Profiler
Find and setup a profiler that works on your system.
Find some Rust code that uses the GPU and run it.
If you don't have any code relevant to the kind of projects you do normally, for GPU code you can try out
the ```egui-winit-template``` project, the ```computational_graphs``` framework or the ```gpu_add``` project.

* Does it work with Rust?
* Which metrics can you get out of it?
* Can you see what is happening on the GPU?
* Do you need a different profiler to see what is going on on the GPU?
* Can you see L2 cache hits/misses?
* Can it show you the hot spots in your code?
