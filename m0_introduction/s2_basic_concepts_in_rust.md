# 2️⃣ Basic Concepts in Rust
The following chapter is an absolutely barebones introduction to concepts in Rust which you will need to
understand to read the guide's code. If you would like a more thorough introduction to Rust, there is
a number of [nice tutorials](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) available.

The real contents of this section is the project in ```m0_introduction/code/basic_concepts/```.
Go into the file corresponding to each function being called in the ```main``` function in ```main.rs```
and read all of the comments in order.
The code can also be found [online](https://github.com/absorensen/the-guide/tree/main/m0_introduction/code/basic_concepts).
