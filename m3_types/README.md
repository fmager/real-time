# 1️⃣ Types
Types might not seem to be the sexiest topic of all time, but don't you worry. Knowing about types
will be a good investment of your time. Whether to use a 32-bit or 64-bit number is not just a matter
of whether your program has enough precision to go around, but can be a source of bugs and buggy
behavior. Sometimes you may even need to guarantee that your system yields at minimum some level
of precision in very real world terms for your users to be satisfied using your system.

You can reduce the strain on your memory bandwidth by using smaller types (think back to
cache lines) and get more data elements per cache line resulting in being less memory bound
which might in turn increase the speed of your program. If you are on a GPU, your performance
might improve significantly (factor 32) by going from 64-bit floats to 32-bits, you can
even get access to tensor cores, by reducing precision even further, allowing an even greater
improvement to the speed of your program. Knowing more about types allows you to sort, order
and quantize your processed data in a way that has as small an impact on precision as possible
while decreasing the size of your data. This could result in faster download times or you could stream
your data from disk directly to the GPU, where the GPU itself might be able to unpack the data.

Which types you are using have an impact not just on speed and size, but also the energy
consumption of your programs. In general, less bits mean less energy consumed and integers
cost less energy to process compared to floats. You don't have to micromanage every single
variable all the time, but one of the first places to look when optimizing should be arrays.
```u8``` rarely matters, but ```[u8]``` sure does.

Finally, knowing about types allows us to operate directly on the underlying bits, casting
from one type to another, to create tightly packed information, which we couldn't otherwise
have, such as packing three dimensional indices into just 32 or 64 bit integers.
